    <strong>Welcome to NewsMuse!</strong> NewsMuse is a prototype of a
      newspaper design database for newspaper page designers seeking inspiration
      for their next layout.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm Julianne, the creator of this site. I used designs from my own portfolio as a starting point. From 2013 to
      2014, I worked as a copy editor and page designer at the
      <em>Carroll County Times</em> in Westminster, Maryland. In 2015, I joined
      the copy desk of <em>The Frederick News-Post</em> in Frederick, Maryland, where I worked until
      2018. Above is a photo of the FNP copy desk crew in summer 2018. From left are Terence, slot; Ben, trivia wizard; Justin, copy chief; Joseph, former copy chief; Katlynn, illustrator extraordinaire; and me.

    <p>While there are several websites that highlight newspaper design, such as the Society for News Design, News Page Designer, and the Newseum, none of these sites attempts to categorize page designs by their shared visual elements. News Page Designer, for instance, groups designs together by section, such as "online," "news," "sports," "features," "infographics," "illustration," and "magazine." But what if a page designer is looking for examples of creative banner headlines or photo illustrations but does not care about the section of the paper in which they appear? NewsMuse aims to provide more granular metadata about features of page design.</p>
