            <strong>Welcome to NewsMuse!</strong> NewsMuse is a prototype of a
            newspaper design database for newspaper page designers seeking
            inspiration for their next layout.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm Julianne, and I created this site using designs from my own
            portfolio as a starting point. From 2013 to 2014, I worked as a copy
            editor and page designer at the
            <em>Carroll County Times</em> in Westminster, Maryland. In 2015, I
            joined the copy desk of <em>The Frederick News-Post</em> in
            Frederick, Maryland, where I worked until 2018. Above is a photo of
            the FNP copy desk crew in summer 2018. From left are Terence, slayer
            of poor syntax (slot editor); Ben, trivia whiz (copy editor and page
            designer); Justin, newsroom clown and world's best manager (copy
            chief); Joseph, fearless leader and patient teacher (former copy
            chief); Katlynn, illustrator extraordinaire (copy editor and page
            designer); and me (copy editor and page designer).
          </p>
          <p>
            While there are several websites that highlight newspaper design,
            such as the
            <a href="https://www.snd.org/">Society for News Design</a>,
            <a href="http://newspagedesigner.org/">News Page Designer</a>, and
            the <a href="https://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/">Newseum</a>,
            none of these sites attempts to categorize page designs by their
            shared visual elements. News Page Designer, for instance, groups
            designs together by section, such as "online," "news," "sports,"
            "features," "infographics," "illustration," and "magazine." But what
            if a page designer is looking for examples of creative display
            headlines or photo illustrations but does not care about the section
            of the paper in which they appear? NewsMuse aims to provide more
            granular metadata about the formal elements of page design so that
            editors working in different departments can learn from one another.
